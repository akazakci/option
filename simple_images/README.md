Images on this folder has been collected from Google using simple_image_download (https://github.com/RiddlerQ/simple_image_download). 

We have collected several images of "rust" - our target category and other categories that have similar color or texture - but are not rust. These categories will be labeled "norust".

There is less than 40 images (~20 for train and ~10 for test), as our aim is to setup TFOD and test the pipeline, rather than to build a performant model.
